In this project we use a covid-19 dataset to draw insights about the 01-05-2021 - 31-10-2021 period in Greece regarding the :

1) Total number of deaths at the end of the 6 month period
2) Total number of new deaths
3) Monthly average number of new deaths
4) Highest number of new deaths per day
5) Average number of  new deaths for each of the last six months
6) New deaths for each date on Octomber 2021.
7) Vaccinated percentage of the population.
8) Months where the percentage of the vaccinated was under 20 perecent?
  
Before proceeding with the analysis of the data we clean and prepare the data as follows : 

1) Replace nulls,blanks with 0s.
2) Create temporary table containing only the Greek records.
3) Create temporary table containing only the Greek records for the last six months.
