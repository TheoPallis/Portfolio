In this project we use a covid-19 dataset to draw insights about the 01-05-2021 - 31-10-2021 period in Greece regarding the :

  1) Total number of deaths at the end of the 6 month period.
	2) Monthly average number of new deaths.
	3) Total number of new deaths.
	4) Average number of  new deaths for each of the last six months.

We also take a broader look at the data for Greece regarding the :

  1) Vaccinated percentage of the population.
	2) Which months was the percentage of the vaccinated under 20 perecent?
	3) New deaths for each date last month.
  
Before proceeding with the analysis of the data we clean and prepare the data as follows : 
	1) Replace nulls,blanks with 0s.
	2) Create temporary table containing only the Greek records.
	3) Create temporary table containing only the Greek records for the last six months.
