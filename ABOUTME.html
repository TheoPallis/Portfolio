										<h1>My Story</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					
									<p>Hi, I am Theo and I am a Business and Data Analyst with a real passion for organisation and process automation.

									</p>
										My story is an interesting one :
										<br> </br>

										<h1>The Beginning</h1>
									
										I hold a BA in Law but early on in my career, I have concluded that Law wouldnâ€™t give me the level of professional and life satisfaction that I was looking for.
										<br></br>
										That was when I started wondering how I could bring value in alternatively to the Law Office I was working as an intern at the time, using my organizational and analytical skills. 
										<br></br>

										This resulted in a drastic facilitating of the work processes, which filled me with an urge to learn more about the software that I could use to increase my efficiency exponentially, namely Excel and Python. 
										<br> </br>
										That was when I made the big leap and started voraciously watching, analysing, and reviewing the relevant material. 
										<br> </br>
										
										<h1>The Learning Phase and the Projects</h1>
										
										Over my learning period i built a strong foundation on Python, SQL, Excel and Tableau.
										<br> </br>
										The more I learned, the more I wanted to translate this knowledge into practice.
										<br> </br>	
										Soon, I found myself initiating various projects, which would simulate real life analysis scenarios and provide valuable insights. You can view them in detail <a href="analyses.html">here</a>.
										
										<br> </br>
										<h1>First steps as a professional</h1>
										During that period, I landed my first freelancing project, which was <a href="Automations.html">extremely successful.</a>


										<br> </br>
										I was looking for a firm with the same passion for Data Analysis as mine, to develop field expertise.

										<br> </br>
										That was when I took on my first role as a Business Analyst in Sioufas and Associates Law Firm, the largest legal firm in Greece.
										<br> </br>
										As I soon realised, the comapny harnessed the power of automation and RPAs to deliver extraordinary results . 	 
										<br> </br>
										I was determined to grow and reach my maximum potential in that role.
										<br> </br>

											
										<h1>Journey to mastery</h1>
										
										In my new role, I worked on utilising Python and Excel to deliver maximum value to the firm in the field of processing, production and organising of digital legal case files and reports.
										<br> </br>
										You can view them in detail <a href="Automations.html">here.</a>
										<br> </br>
										I am a strong proponent of the power of automation. 
										<br> </br>
										<a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/find-a-position-of-leverage">As Naval Ravikant states, code is an incredibly powerful form of leverage.</a>
										<br> </br>
										In my free time, I keep on honing my skills, developing 	AI	and web-scraping scripts that I utilise to maximise my efficiency in my day-to day-life.
										<br> </br>

										</p>
